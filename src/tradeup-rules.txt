Ten inputs, all the same rarity
You must submit exactly ten weapon skins of identical rarity (for example, ten Mil-Spec blues). You cannot mix rarities—no mixing Mil-Spec and Restricted, etc.

Output pool comes only from collections you used
Each input skin belongs to one (or more) collections. Gather every skin one rarity higher from each of those collections; the union of those is your output pool. You cannot receive any skin from a collection that none of your inputs belonged to.

Probability formula
For each collection C, let k_C be the number of your inputs from C, and let m_C be the number of next-tier skins in C. Compute the value sum_over_collections = sum for every collection D of (k_D multiplied by m_D). Then each individual skin in collection C’s next-tier list has probability equal to k_C divided by sum_over_collections.
Example 1: If you have 9 inputs from collection A and collection A has 1 next-tier skin, and you have 1 input from collection B and collection B has 2 next-tier skins, then sum_over_collections = (9 × 1) + (1 × 2) = 11. The single skin from collection A has probability 9/11 (about 81.82 percent). Each of the two skins from collection B has probability 1/11 (about 9.09 percent each).
Example 2: If you change to 8 inputs from A and 2 inputs from B (still m_A = 1, m_B = 2), then sum_over_collections = (8 × 1) + (2 × 2) = 12. The single skin from A has probability 8/12 (66.67 percent). Each of the two skins from B has probability 2/12 (16.67 percent each).

One-tier upgrade only; no knives
You always move up exactly one rarity: Mil-Spec → Restricted, Restricted → Classified, Classified → Covert. You cannot trade up to a knife or gloves; Covert-tier inputs yield only Covert firearms, never rare knives or gloves.

FLOAT CALCULATION
Float equals average of input floats (0–1 scale)
Every input float is already on a 0–1 scale. The output’s float is the arithmetic average of your ten input floats. There is no random float sampling between minimum and maximum; the engine returns the simple average.

Only marketable weapon skins; no souvenirs or contraband
You may only submit marketable weapon skins of the chosen rarity. Souvenir packages, contraband, StatTrak modules, keys, capsules, music kits, stickers, and similar items do not count as inputs.

StatTrak Skins will be ignored.

No hidden weights beyond the formula above
Aside from rarity (only next-tier items appear), collection membership, and the float-averaging rule, there is no other bias. The only factors that determine odds are how many inputs from each collection (k_C) and how many next-tier skins that collection has (m_C).

Workflow summary
Step 1: Choose ten skins of equal rarity.
Step 2: Identify each input’s collection(s).
Step 3: Build the output pool by listing every skin one rarity higher from those collections.
Step 4: For each collection C, count k_C (number of inputs from C) and m_C (number of next-tier skins in C).
Step 5: Compute sum_over_collections = sum for all collections D of (k_D multiplied by m_D).
Step 6: Each output skin in C has probability k_C divided by sum_over_collections.
Step 7: The output’s float is the average of your ten input floats scaled to the output skin's float range.
